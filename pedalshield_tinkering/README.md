# pedalshield_tinkering

I was using [pedalSHIELD DUE](https://www.electrosmash.com/pedalshield) to make effects for my Rhodes piano. However, I ended up frying the arduino before reaching my goal of simulating a nice tube amp and tremelo effect.

However, the `bitSmasher` effect in [this file](https://github.com/bmcmenamin/sundries/blob/master/pedalshield_tinkering/rhodesModes/bitSmasher/bitSmasher.ino) has nice effects from quantizing the along the dimensions of time and/or amplitude. Light amplitude quantization is a surprisingly nice way to add light distortion.
