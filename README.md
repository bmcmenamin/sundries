Little things I want to keep but not give their own repo

* `plottingNetworkLayout` has some cod eI was using to extend TSNA layouts to the time domain to show netowkr structure evolving over time.
* `pedalshield_tinkering` has scripts I was using for an Arduino project to simulate a tube amp and tremelo for my Rhodes using the [pedalSHIELD DUE](https://www.electrosmash.com/pedalshield).
    * UPDATE: I fried the arduino. project is dead.
* `tensorFlowFaces` was a project to learn TensorFlow by building a convnet that predicted facial attractiveness.
* `theanoStocks` was a project to start learning Theano on stock timeseries.
