Little things I want to keep but not give their own repo

  * write up [here](https://bmcmenamin.github.io/2017/11/19/census.html)
* `fluff_ball` has code for analyzing the distribution of data in a multivariate gaussian
  * write up [here](https://bmcmenamin.github.io/2018/01/24/fluff-balls.html)
* `gcloud_scripts` has scripts used to set up tensorflow environments on Google Cloud
  * write up [here](https://bmcmenamin.github.io/2018/03/17/setting-up-gcloud.html)
* `gummibot` has the twitterbot for running [this account](https://twitter.com/johnwilliamsso1/with_replies?lang=en)
* `inaturalist` has some machine vision models built for a Kaggle challenge using ModelWrangler.
  * I never got around to submitting results, so no write up
* `moby_sequel` teaching a robot to write a seque to Moby Dick
  * write ups [here](https://bmcmenamin.github.io/2018/02/24/moby-dick-2.html) and [thar](https://bmcmenamin.github.io/2018/03/16/moby-dick-2-update.html)
* `pedalshield_tinkering` has scripts I was using for an Arduino project to simulate a tube amp and tremelo for my Rhodes using the [pedalSHIELD DUE](https://www.electrosmash.com/pedalshield).
    * UPDATE: I fried the arduino. project is dead.
* `plottingNetworkLayout` has some cod eI was using to extend TSNA layouts to the time domain to show netowkr structure evolving over time.
* `tensorFlowFaces` was a project to learn TensorFlow by building a convnet that predicted facial attractiveness.
* `theanoStocks` was a project to start learning Theano on stock timeseries.
