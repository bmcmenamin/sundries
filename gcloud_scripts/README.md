# gCloud Scripts

These are scripts I use to set up Google Cloud Compute engines.

* `mount_disk.sh` will let you mount persistent disks on a new compute instance
* `setup_instance_tensorflow.sh` will install tensorflow on a CPU or GPU machine, including all the NVIDIA packages for the GPU. It can build tensorflow from source if you want.
